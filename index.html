    <h2>Git Introduction</h2>

    <p>Git (/ɡɪt/)[7] is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).[8][9][10]

        Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.[11] Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.[12] Git is free and open-source software distributed under GNU General Public License Version 2.</p>


    <h2>GitHub</h2>

    <p>GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project.[4] Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.[5]

        It is commonly used to host open-source projects.[6] As of January 2020, GitHub reports having over 40 million users[7] and more than 190 million repositories[8] (including at least 28 million public repositories).[9] It is the largest source code host as of April 2020.[10]</p>
